# SmartAgro-ChatBot
This is a multilingual (English + Hindi) chatbot for smartagro.

# Description:
It is basically an action for google assistant which uses dialogflow +firebase + GCP .
I've created a custom agent (in NodeJS) and mapped majority of SmartAgro's functionality using BrowseCarousel .

The agent(agent.zip) with intents and entities can be downloaded for restoring directly using dialogflow.The custom fulfillment webhooks are index.js and package.json

# P.S: 
Google does not allow ecommerce (third party transactions to be linked in action) and hence the link to actual app is provided instead of the ecommerce.
